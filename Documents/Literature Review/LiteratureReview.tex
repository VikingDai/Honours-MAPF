	% Why
	\noindent The order picking process is the number one expense in the operating cost of warehouse systems. This project will look at \textit{part-to-picker}, a method of order picking where orders are retrieved and delivered to a number of picking areas located around the warehouse. Previous research has improved on multi-agent path finding (MAPF) algorithms but mostly overlooked the potential benefits gained by configuring the warehouse layout.
	% What
	Here, we will be exploring Kiva systems a part-to-picker system which uses autonomous vehicles and mobile storage. Our focus is to explore a number of adjustments and additions which we expect will greatly affect how we design warehouse layouts.
	% How
	These include: introducing an intermediate dropping zone, optimizing order processing and adding the capability for robots to maneuver under storage pods.
	% Where
	The results of this project will help identify how we should position storage and picking stations in a warehouse. Additionally, we will be looking at developing a MAPF method which uses a pre-computed path oracle.

\section{Introduction}
Order picking is a process in warehouse systems whereby products are retrieved from storage to satisfy incoming customer orders. This process has been identified by \cite{de2007design} as the most expensive process in operating a warehouse, estimated to take 55\% of the warehouse operating cost.

Here we look at a method of order picking known as part-to-picker systems. Part-to-picker systems contain multiple picking stations located around the warehouse. Products are brought to picking stations where workers will manually pick and process the product. One of the disadvantages of part-to-picker systems is that there will be some downtime at the picking stations while waiting for an order to be delivered. To solve this, these systems often use an automated storage and retrieval system (AS/RS). \cite{introduction2015autostore} is a recent part-to-picker system where products are organized in a grid of stacked bins. Robots move around the top of the grid, lifting bins and delivering them to picking areas. Benefits of the AutoStore system include high storage density and expansion capability. While not much literature is published about the specifics of AutoStore, we suspect the major downsides are: slow, expensive order retrieval as well as high infrastructure and maintenance costs.

In this project, we look at Kiva Systems (now known as Amazon Robotics). In Kiva systems, products are stored in mobile shelves known as storage pods. Robots known as drive units are responsible for retrieving and delivering storage pods to picking stations. A human worker is stationed at each picking station who picks the item off the pod before processing it (Fig \ref{kivaprocess}). Once the pod has been processed, the drive unit will return the pod to an appropriate location in the warehouse.


%\noindent The process of order retrieval for a drive unit is as follows:
%\begin{compactenum}
%	\item Unit is told to retrieve a product
%	\item Unit moves to the storage pod containing the product and picks up the pod
%	\item Unit carries the pod to a picking station
%	\item Human worker picks the product from the pod and packs it
%	\item Unit returns the pod back to where it was picked up
%	\item Unit is told to retrieve a product
%\end{compactenum}

Kiva systems do not require a complex infrastructure to operate, a warehouse needs only a suitible number of storage pods, picking stations and drive units to operate. As long as the warehouse has space, more robots, pods or stations can be easily be added to the system to satisfy the incoming flow of customer orders. When a drive unit malfunctions it can be easily accessed and replaced. In summary, the main benefits of Kiva systems are their low initial and maintenance costs and their rapid deployment and flexibility (\cite{wurman2008coordinating}).

\subsection{Research questions}
We aim to explore two areas of Kiva systems, the layout and MAPF. These can be summarized in the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How will the adjustments and additions below affect our decision when it comes to configuring the warehouse layout?
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Adding an intermediate zone where drive units may drop off storage pods
		\item Adding the capability for drive units to maneuver under storage pods
		\item Implementing an optimized order process

	\end{compactitem}

\item How much faster will the MAPF search run by pre-computing paths and storing them in a path oracle?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
\label{background}
% Description of MAPF problem, including objective function

In Kiva systems, we face a multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem. MAPF aims to find a path for each agent to their goal while ensuring that no path conflicts with another. MAPF has usage in video games, robotics (\cite{bennewitz2002finding}), search and rescue (\cite{konolige2006centibots}) and warehouse applications. When analyzing the efficiency of a MAPF algorithm we generally aim to reduce the makespan of the system. Additionally, in Kiva systems we want to reduce the downtime of picking stations.

% How hard is it?
Finding an optimal solution in MAPF is an NP-hard problem (\cite{yu2013structure}) and mostly has found usage in systems containing a small number agents. This is not an option as Kiva systems deal with hundreds of agents, for example the Office Supply company, Staples uses 500 robots in their $30000m^{2}$ center (\cite{guizzo2008three}). Here we look at finding a bounded suboptimal solution and this has been explored in Kiva systems by (\cite{cohen2016bounded}).

% What are the main way people solve it?
To improve MAPF, generally methods are created to simplify the problem, \cite{cohen2016bounded} define user-provided highways to help guide agents towards a specific direction, greatly reducing the chance of path collisions. \cite{wilt2014spatially} identifies bottlenecks in the environment and assigns a controller which handles agents who want to pass through the bottleneck, simplifying agent behaviour in high collision zones. Another common technique is grouping agents into teams. \cite{ma2016optimal} splits agents into teams of 5 and presents a Conflict-Based Min-Cost-Flow algorithm which and shows that they can achieve a correct, complete and optimal solution.

% What are the main advantages and drawbacks of each approach?

%\cite{de2007design} provides a great overview of picking
Specific to the process of order picking, we will look at the method of order processing. Take an example where products of the same type are grouped together in a warehouse. If a large order of one product comes in, the agents will all try to find a path to this one area and create many collisions in the MAPF. We want the goal locations for our drive units to be spread evenly around the warehouse and order processing allows this by looking at two areas. Firstly, by evenly distributing products around the warehouse. If we place products of the same type across many different row around the warehouse, a large order of one product will be no issue. Secondly, is sequencing of incoming orders. Instead of processing the large orders of one product sequentially, we have some flexibility to interlace this large order with other orders which we know we will need to process. Essentially, we can move the mobile storage pods as well adjust the incoming ordering sequence to benefit the MAPF. \cite{boysen2017parts} looks at both these aspects in unison and found that with optimized order processing, only half the units are required to provide the supply given by a non-optimized system.

%\cite{wurman2008coordinating} provides an in depth overview of Kiva Systems, describing their benefits, usages and research areas.

%\cite{gu2010research} provides a comprehensive review of warehouse design and performance. It covers 5 major aspects, overall structure, sizing and dimensioning, department layout, equipment selection and operation strategy selection.

%\cite{de2007design} provides a survey on order picking

%\cite{strasser2015compressing} uses Compressed Path Databases.

%Unlike existing literature, in this project we aim looking at a number of other factors which are likely to simplify the pathfinding problem.
